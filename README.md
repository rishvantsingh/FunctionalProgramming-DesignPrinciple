# FunctionalProgramming-DesignPrinciple

Background of solid design principle implemented  by me.

Why we should implement functional principle in a programming language?

The huge intention of the SOLID ideas is to lessen dependencies in order that engineers alternate one vicinity of software program with out impacting others. Additionally, theyâ€™re supposed to make designs simpler to understand, maintain, and extend. Ultimately, the use of those layout ideas makes it simpler for software program engineers to keep away from problems and to construct adaptive, effective, and agile software program.

THe Solid design principle which i implemented to rectify and and make my program adaptive are:

1-Dependency Inversion 
2-LSP
3-SIngle Responsibility Principle
